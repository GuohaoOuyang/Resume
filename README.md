## Project title
Editable Resume -- a fullstack resume

## Motivation
Inspired by to do list app, I decide to create an resume version that one can easily add, delete your bulletpoints. You can choose your font weight and where to add. It finally comes out as a full stack version by adding a backend api with express and mongoDB.
